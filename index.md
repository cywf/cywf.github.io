# Kylo Parisher – Personal Portfolio  
Bienvenidos! Welcome to my personal portfolio site hosted via GitHub Pages. I’m Kylo Parisher (KP), a security engineer, AI/ML researcher, instructor, and founder of PR‑CYBR. My mission is to build resilient systems that protect and empower communities.  

## About Me  
I balance roles as an AI & ML research engineer, security instructor, and lifelong student. My work spans cybersecurity, executive protection, psionics, space systems, and quantum exploration. Guided by the Seven Hermetic Principles, I focus on ethical innovation and intergenerational stewardship through initiatives like the G8 System.  

## PR‑CYBR  
[PR‑CYBR](https://github.com/pr-cybr) is a Puerto Rico initiative I founded to promote digital resilience and education. It aims to build community protection and drive innovation in cybersecurity, AI/ML, and technology.  

## Projects & Initiatives  
This GitHub portfolio highlights some of my key projects and interests, including:  
- **AI/ML & Security Tools:** automation, defense, and ethical AI for cybersecurity.  
- **Space & Quantum:** research on space systems and quantum communications.  
- **Open‑source contributions:** forks and tools that support the wider community.  
- **Education & Community:** teaching with Executive Security International (ESI) and building training programs for security professionals.  

I also maintain dedicated GitHub Pages for select repositories. Each project page provides up‑to‑date information and visual data about the project’s status.
