# Background Story 

generate a profile description of a 26 year old named "Kylo", that has traveled and moved around all of his life, was a military child, served in the U.S. Army for 3 years as a 12B Combat Engineer and Paratrooper with the 82nd Airborne Division 1st Brigade Combat Team, 127th Engineer Battalion, Alpha Company. As a Combat Engineer, his duties where to ensure the security of military installations, garrisons, Forward Operating Bases, and Offensive & Defensive Terrain Obstacles, his technical job specialization was build & defusing Explosive Ordinances, searching, disabling, and removing Improvised Explosive Devices. He trained and was licensed to Operate Heavy Equiptment and Vehicles, Also, he went to additional training schools such as: Combat Life Saver (CLS) course, Radio Communications Specialist training (signal), Basic Leadership Course (BLS), Air Assault school, Sapper School, and Ranger School After getting hurt on a Parachute Jump during a overseas training exercise known as "ROTC" in Germany, he received a medical discharge order, where he would be classified as medically retired, and receiving an Honorable Discharge, National Defense Service Medal, Global War on Terrorism Medal, Army Good Conduct, and Army Achievement Medal. 

During his transition out of the Army, his unit allowed him to start on furthering his education, by attending a computer technical training school in Raleigh, NC. Kylo drove hours back and forth each day, to obtain training and obtain technical certifications like: CompTIA A+, Net+, Security+, Cloud+, CySA+, Server+, CCNA, CSSP, Linux+, MS-101, MS-102, MS-CP, AWS Cloud Practitioner, GCP Cloud Security Engineer . 

After medically discharging from the army in 2017 he moved back home to Asheville, NC and got a job with a company called "Eaton", where he stepped into the world of Electrical Engineering as an Junior Electrical Engineer. His job was to help design, build, and assemble Medium Voltage Transformers for Industrial High Voltage Generators, that are used in Power Plants, Hospitals, Manufacturing Plants, and other Critical Infrastructure Industries. Additionally during his time at Eaton, he received his first aid, CPR, AED, and Basic Life Support certifications and licenses, there soon after being appointed a Safety Security Officer for the manufacturing plant, after noticing and reporting overlooked security vulnerabilities, both physical and electronically. He responsibly reported this using his chain of command, and for such, received acknowledgment from the CEO of the company during a shareholder meeting as employee of the month.

After being with Eaton for 6 months (in 2017), Kylo received an offer of an opportunity to step into the Network Engineering sector (in 2018). Where he worked as a IT Field Technician at the very same hospital his daughter Bella Nova was born. As a contractor of TEKSystems, his job was to deploy, troubleshoot, and support the roll out of a new critical communications device, that was meant to improve communications between CNA's, Nurses's, LPN's, and Doctors so that they reduced the reaction time, while responding to patients and code level events.

After finishing his contract, he reached out to a fellow church member who owned his own construction management company that handled large projects, and who gave him his very first job at 15 years old as a roofer's assistant, repairing and restoring roofs of homes and buildings. He immediately offered Kylo a position in his company as Foreman for a $2.7 million dollar project that he just started. As a Forman, Kylo's duties were to respond to construction teams when they ran into any issue with supply, materials, complaints, accidents, and design issues, where then he worked directly with the Architect, and Project Lead to correct design issues, and budget requests. In his time as a Forman, he worked with a diverse number of groups from different parts of the world. This let Kylo learn a basic fluency in: Spanish, Ukranian, Russian, Romania, German, Portuguese, and French languages.

After successfully finishing the project as Forman in Asheville, NC, he moved to Virginia to be closer to his Daughter, and continue furthering his education in IT. He used his G.I. Bill; a benefit you get from the military, that pays for active duty, reserve, national guar, and veterans, and started attending ECPI University. Studying at ECPI; which is an accelerated technical college, he chose to major in Computer and Network Security, with a minor in Software Development & Mechanical Engineering. While attending ECPI, he was active in many clubs, including the Networking Club, as club President, and in the Cybersecurity Club, as a CTF team member, competing in University CTF Tournaments with ODU, CDU, VT, UNC, Chapel Hill, and HMU. 

At night he would work part time at Best Buy, where he sold computers and networking gear, received employee of the month, having the highest sales growth in his department. Soon after, he was offered a position with the Geek Squad as a Security Agent (Best Buys special computer department). As a Security Agent of Geek Squad, Kylo's duties were handling Computer Repair, Restoration, preforming Malware and Virus Removal, Data Recovery, including being a Network Installation Field Technician Crew Agent. 

During this time, working both a job at Best Buy, and attending school at ECPI University, he was struggling through a lot of family issues, that lead to him to having no where to go, resulting in him becoming homeless. During this time, he was applying for government contract positions and got a lucky break, and landed a job as a Tier 1 Agent working on the Service Desk (NMCI) as a government contractor for the U.S. Navy in Norfolk Virginia. As a Tier 1 Agent, Kylo's responsibilities were to provide technical support to over +800,000 active duty, federal, and contract employees. During his time as a Tier 1 Agent, he stood out to his superiors, when he went above the call of duty and wrote and improved outdated technical manuals that the Agents often referred to when working on a call. Every call, was signed a ticket, and tracked in real time on the Agents progress working to resolve the issue of the client. The calls were timed, and often rushed by the Agents, because if their calls go over 15min, they were to be subject to an infraction, had they not followed the procedures to the very second to avoid negative marks on their performance reviews. Kylo experienced the same issues and decided to do something about it. So he created powershell scripts that automated a lot of the initial process of obtaining the basic computer information, without having to remote into the clients machine, or talk them through finding and reading the needed information in order for the Agent to help resolve the issue. He then created more scripts, Kylo's scripts helped automate the output and input of that information in templates that he built, that then searched the database for manuals that pertained to that specific issue and added it too / populated the manuals into the template, helping the Agent find the answers to technical questions, and automatically obtaining information needed to troubleshoot and resolve tickets. He received recognition from his peers and superiors for this, and was offered a promotion to Tier 2 Agent, where he accepted, and moved to supporting the U.S. Navy Nuclear Division service desk department (NNPI). As a Tier 2 Agent, Kylo handled the tickets that couldn't be resolved by the Tier 1 Agents, or tickets that required Kylo to hold a Secret Security Clearance, due to working on Navy Nuclear IT Infrastructure.  

Soon after finishing his contract, there was a global shutdown, leaving him out of work, living in a big city, yarning to be outdoors. Having being in school for awhile now (2018-2019), he obtained his associates in Software Development & Engineering. He decided to take a break from school since his classes were now all online and/or on pause or delay. He moved back to Asheville, NC and worked part time as lead Engineer for the same company he worked once before as a Forman before moving to Virginia. During that time, he spent a lot of time outdoors, hiking, camping, and exploring the mountains. He had a goal to hike the Appalacian trail from Georgia to Maine. Doing bits and peices of it. One day on the trail in Hot Springs, NC he met two river guiides that had their kayaks beached on shore. They talked for quite some time, and told Kylo about the company they worked for called "Nantahala Outdoor Center" in Bryson City, NC. Kylo was immediatly intrigued and decided to apply to be a Mountain Biking Guide with his highschool friend he was staying with named "kyle". Togther, they packed up and moved into the staff cabins, in the middle of a gorge, with nothing but outdoor activities to do. They worked as guides for the summer, and had a blast. They were able to hike, bike, kayak, and raft all day, and then go to work and do it all over again. Will during the night, all of the guides gathering around the fire pit, telling stories, and playing games, and dancing. It was a great time of Kylo's life. By that point, he had lost 155 pounds, gained a new skill set, and was in the best shape of his life. Aspiring him to obtain his Wilderness Emerciancy Medical Technician (EMT) certification. Where his prior experience in the military, being a saftey officer at Eaton, and his new experience as a guide, helped him pass the test with flying colors.
